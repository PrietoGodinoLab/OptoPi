Here, we present OptoPi, an open source, affordable (~ £600), behavioural arena with accompanying multi-animal tracking software. The system features highly customisable and reproducible visible and infrared illumination and allows for temporally precise optogenetic stimulation. OptoPi acquires images using a Raspberry Pi camera, features motorised LED-based illumination, Arduino control, as well as spectrum and irradiance monitoring to fine-tune
illumination conditions with real time feedback.

Our open-source software (BIO) can be used to simultaneously track multiple animals while accurately keeping individual animal’s identity both in on-line and off-line modes. 

## BIO

For animal tracking we utilise and recommend BIO created by Joost de Folter. Currently, we use the [v1.7.6 release](https://github.com/folterj/BioImageOperation/releases/tag/v1.7.6). For the latest, actively maintained BIO repository see [BIO](https://github.com/folterj/BioImageOperation).
